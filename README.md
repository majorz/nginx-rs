# Nginx module development with Rust [stalled]

*Unfortunatelly Nginx 1.x does not maintain a stable ABI â€“ core structures
are changing with minor releases, which makes it very hard to maintain
compatibility between each Nginx version and this FFI wrapper project.
Further development is discontinued.*

For alternative, please, check the Apache module development with Rust project:
